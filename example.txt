'some text'
'new line'
When I make a change to the file I have to 'add' that file again and 'commit'
including a comment on the change: git commit -m 'description of change'

'git log HEAD~1' will show changes on the previous version of the file

to creat a repository on github, after creating it:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jvillasr/gitworkshop.git
